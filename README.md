## Usage

Access all Aventurine tools through the **N-panel** in the 3D Viewport (press `N` to toggle) under the **"Aventurine LoL"** tab.

### Import and Export

The main panel provides controls for importing and exporting League of Legends asset files:

- **SKN files**: Mesh data with vertex weights and materials
- **SKL files**: Skeletal armature structures
- **ANM files**: Animation data compatible with League rigs

**Important**: When exporting, verify your settings to ensure the correct armature or mesh is selected for export.

### Physics Simulation

Enable Animation Tools in the addon preferences to access the **Animation Tools** tab in the N-panel. This feature automates secondary motion for elements like hair, cloth, and accessories, providing realistic movement without manual keyframing.

### Animation Retargeting

The **LoL Retarget** option (available when enabled in preferences) allows you to transfer animations between different skeletons. This is particularly useful for:

- Adapting animations to custom rigs
- Sharing animations across different champions
- Testing animations on various character models
